## Workspace vs User Settings

All Quarto Wizard settings are scoped to "resource", meaning they can be configured at:

- **User level**: Applies to all workspaces.
- **Workspace level**: Applies only to the current workspace.
- **Folder level**: Applies only to a specific folder in a multi-root workspace.

Folder settings override workspace settings, which override user settings.

## Example Configuration

Here is an example `settings.json` with all Quarto Wizard settings:
