## Keyboard Shortcuts

By default, Quarto Wizard does not define keyboard shortcuts.
You can add custom keybindings in VS Code's Keyboard Shortcuts settings.

Example keybinding for installing extensions:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+shift+q",
  "command": "quartoWizard.installExtension"
}
```

## Command Identifiers

For scripting or keybinding purposes, here are the internal command identifiers:
