title: "Extension Snippet Specification"
---

Quarto extensions can provide a `_snippets.json` file for snippet completion and insertion in Quarto Wizard.
The file format follows the standard VS Code snippet JSON specification.
For the complete format reference, see [VS Code: Snippet syntax](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_snippet-syntax).

## File Location

Place `_snippets.json` in the same directory as `_extension.yml`.

```text
_extensions/
  my-extension/
    _extension.yml
    _snippets.json
```

Quarto Wizard discovers snippet files automatically when scanning installed extensions.

## Minimal Example

```json
{
  "Callout Note": {
    "prefix": "callout-note",
    "body": ["::: {.callout-note}", "$0", ":::"],
    "description": "Insert a callout note block."
  }
}
```

## Quarto Wizard Behaviour

- Snippets are shown under each installed extension in the Explorer view.
- Snippets are available in IntelliSense for Quarto documents.
- Snippet prefixes are namespaced as `<owner>-<extension>:<prefix>` (or `<extension>:<prefix>` when no owner exists) to avoid collisions.
- Selecting **Insert Snippet** from the Explorer inserts the snippet body into the active editor.
