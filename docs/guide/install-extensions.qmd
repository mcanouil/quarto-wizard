## Installation Sources

Quarto Wizard supports installing extensions from multiple sources:

### From Registry (Default)

Use `Quarto Wizard: Install Extensions` to browse and install from the official registry.

### From GitHub

Use `Quarto Wizard: Install Extension from Registry` and enter a GitHub repository in the format `owner/repository`.

### From URL

Use `Quarto Wizard: Install Extension from URL` to install from a direct archive URL (`.zip` or `.tar.gz`).

### From Local Path

## Trust and Confirmation

- Installing an extension.

You can adjust these prompts in [Configuration](../reference/configuration.qmd).
