Before using Quarto Wizard, ensure you have the following prerequisites.

## System Requirements

### Visual Studio Code

- VS Code version 1.96.0 or later.
- Alternatively, Positron IDE is also supported.

### Quarto CLI

Quarto Wizard requires Quarto to be installed on your system.

- Download and install Quarto from [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
- Ensure Quarto is available in your system's PATH.

To verify Quarto is installed correctly, run:

```{.bash filename="Terminal"}
quarto --version
```

### Internet Connection

An active internet connection is required for:

- Fetching the extension registry.
- Downloading and installing extensions from GitHub.
- Checking for extension updates.

## Optional: GitHub Authentication

For accessing private repositories or avoiding rate limits, you can configure GitHub authentication:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
2. Run `Quarto Wizard: Set GitHub Token (Manual)`.
3. Enter your GitHub personal access token.

Alternatively, Quarto Wizard can use:

- VS Code's built-in GitHub authentication.
- Environment variables (`GITHUB_TOKEN` or `QUARTO_WIZARD_TOKEN`).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the output log: Run `Quarto Wizard: Show Quarto Wizard Log Output` from the Command Palette.
2. Verify your internet connection.
3. Ensure Quarto is properly installed and in your PATH.
