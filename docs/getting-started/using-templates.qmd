title: "Using Templates"

Quarto Wizard allows you to quickly start new documents using pre-configured templates from the extension registry.

## What are Templates?

Templates are special Quarto extensions that include starter files for specific document types, such as:

- Academic papers.
- Presentation slides.
- Letters and invoices.
- Journal article formats.

When you use a template, Quarto Wizard:

1. Installs the extension.
2. Copies the template files to your workspace.

## Using the Template Browser

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Type `Quarto Wizard: Use Template` and select it.
3. Browse the list of available templates.

## Installing a Template

1. Select the template you want to use.
2. Choose the workspace folder where the template should be installed.
3. Select which template files to copy (if multiple are available).
4. Confirm any file overwrites if necessary.

## Template Files

Templates typically include:

- A `.qmd` starter document.
- Custom styling files (CSS, SCSS).
- Configuration files.
- Example content.

The "Use Template" command only retrieves the Quarto document and basic resources.
For templates with additional resources (such as bibliography files or complex directory structures), you may need to use `quarto use template` manually.

## Recently Used Templates

Quarto Wizard keeps track of your recently used templates for quick access.
These appear at the top of the template browser.

To clear this list, use `Quarto Wizard: Clear Recently Installed Extensions`.

## Accessing Templates from Context Menu

You can also access the template browser from:

- The Explorer context menu (right-click in the file explorer).
- The Editor context menu (right-click in an editor).
- The Quarto Wizard Explorer View toolbar.
