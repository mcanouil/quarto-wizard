This guide helps you resolve common issues with Quarto Wizard.

## Viewing the Output Log

The first step in troubleshooting is to check the output log:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Run `Quarto Wizard: Show Quarto Wizard Log Output`.
3. Review the log for error messages or warnings.

![](images/output-log-dark.png "Output Log: Quarto Wizard"){
.dark-content
.img-fluid .img-thumbnail .rounded-3 .border-light
width="500px" fig-align="center" group="quarto-wizard-dark"
fig-alt='{{< meta alt-text.output-log >}}'
}

width="500px" fig-align="center" group="quarto-wizard-light"
fig-alt='{{< meta alt-text.output-log >}}'
}

You can adjust the log level in [Configuration](../reference/configuration.qmd) to see more detailed information.

## Common Issues

### Extensions Not Loading

**Symptoms**: The extension browser is empty or shows an error.

**Solutions**:

1. Check your internet connection.
2. Verify the registry URL in settings is correct.
3. Clear the extension cache: `Quarto Wizard: Clear Extension Cache`.
4. Check the output log for specific error messages.

### Installation Fails

**Symptoms**: Extension installation reports an error.

**Solutions**:

1. Check the output log for the specific error.
2. Verify you have write permissions to the workspace folder.
3. Ensure the `_extensions` directory is not locked by another process.
4. For GitHub-hosted extensions, check if the repository exists and is accessible.

### Update Detection Not Working

**Symptoms**: Extensions don't show as having updates available.

**Causes**:

- The extension was not installed by Quarto Wizard.
- The extension's `_extension.yml` lacks a `source` field.

**Solutions**:

1. Manually add `source: owner/repository` to the extension's `_extension.yml`.
2. Reinstall the extension using Quarto Wizard.

### GitHub Rate Limiting

**Symptoms**: "Rate limit exceeded" errors.

**Solutions**:

1. Configure GitHub authentication (see [Installation](installation.qmd#optional-github-authentication)).
2. Wait for the rate limit to reset (usually one hour).
3. Use `Quarto Wizard: Set GitHub Token (Manual)` to add a personal access token.

### Extensions Not Appearing in Explorer View

**Symptoms**: Installed extensions don't show in the Explorer View.

**Solutions**:

1. Click the Refresh button in the Explorer View toolbar.
2. Ensure the extensions are in the `_extensions` directory.
3. Check that each extension has a valid `_extension.yml` file.
