The Explorer View displays:

## Extension Status Indicators

Extensions may display different indicators:

- **Update available**: A cloud icon indicates a newer version is available.

## Update Detection

Quarto Wizard can detect when updates are available for your installed extensions.

Extensions can only be updated if they were installed by Quarto Wizard or have `source: <owner>/<repository>` in their `_extension.yml` file.
You can manually add the source field to enable update detection.
