Quarto Wizard makes it easy to browse and install Quarto extensions from multiple sources.

## Using the Extension Browser

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Type `Quarto Wizard: Install Extensions` and select it.
3. Browse the list of available extensions.

## Browsing Extensions

The extension browser displays:

- **Extension name**: The name of the extension.
- **Author**: The extension's creator.
- **Version**: The latest available version.
- **Stars**: GitHub star count.
- **Description**: A brief description of what the extension does.
- **Licence**: The extension's licence type.

You can:

- **Search**: Type to filter extensions by name, author, or description.
- **Sort**: Order by name, stars, or recently updated.
- **Filter**: Show only specific types of extensions.

## Installing an Extension

1. Select the extension(s) you want to install.
2. Press Enter or click to confirm your selection.
3. Choose the workspace folder where the extension should be installed.
4. Confirm the installation when prompted.

The extension will be downloaded and installed to the `_extensions` directory in your chosen workspace folder.

## Installation Sources

Quarto Wizard supports installing extensions from multiple sources.

### From Registry (Default)

Use `Quarto Wizard: Install Extensions` to browse and install from the official registry.

### From GitHub

Use `Quarto Wizard: Install Extension from Registry` and enter a GitHub repository in the format `owner/repository`.

### From URL

Use `Quarto Wizard: Install Extension from URL` to install from a direct archive URL (`.zip` or `.tar.gz`).

### From Local Path

Use `Quarto Wizard: Install Extension from Local` to install from a local directory or archive file.

## Installing from Local Sources

You can install Quarto extensions from local directories or archive files.
This is useful when:

- Sharing extensions between projects.
- Installing extensions from downloaded archives.
- Working with extensions in development.

### Using the Context Menu

Right-click on a folder or archive file (`.zip`, `.tar.gz`, `.tgz`) in the Explorer and select `Quarto Wizard` > `Install Extension from Local`.

::: {#fig-context-menu-local}

{{< placeholder 600 400 >}}

The context menu when right-clicking a folder or archive, showing the "Install Extension from Local" option in the Quarto Wizard submenu.
:::

### How It Works

1. If the source contains an `_extensions/` folder with multiple extensions, you can select which ones to install.
2. Choose the target workspace folder (if multiple workspaces are open).
3. For each conflicting extension, choose to overwrite or skip.

For archives, Quarto Wizard will extract the contents and look for an `_extensions/` folder.
If the source is a single extension (no `_extensions/` folder), it will be installed directly.

### Extension Selection

When installing from local sources, you can select which extensions to install:

::: {#fig-extension-selection}

{{< placeholder 600 400 >}}

The QuickPick dialog showing a list of discovered extensions with checkboxes for multi-selection.
:::

### Conflict Resolution

If an extension already exists in the target location, you will be asked whether to overwrite or skip it:

::: {#fig-conflict-resolution}

{{< placeholder 600 400 >}}

The modal dialog asking whether to overwrite or skip a conflicting extension.
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
If the source contains an `_extensions/` folder, you can select which extensions to install.
Otherwise, the source is treated as a single extension and installed directly.
:::

## Quarto Version Validation

Some extensions specify a minimum Quarto version requirement in their `_extension.yml` file using the `quarto-required` field.
Quarto Wizard validates this requirement before installation if the [Quarto VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto) is installed.

### How It Works

1. Before installing, Quarto Wizard checks if the extension specifies a `quarto-required` version.
2. If the Quarto VS Code extension is available, it retrieves your current Quarto CLI version.
3. If your version does not meet the requirement, a warning dialog appears with:
   - The required version.
   - Your current version.
   - Options to "Install Anyway" or "Cancel".

::: {.callout-note}
The Quarto VS Code extension is optional.
If it is not installed, version validation is silently skipped and the installation proceeds normally.
Quarto Wizard will never prompt you to install the Quarto extension.
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
Installing an extension with an unmet version requirement may result in the extension not working correctly.
Consider updating your Quarto CLI to the required version for best results.
:::

## Trust and Confirmation

By default, Quarto Wizard asks for confirmation before:

- Trusting a new extension author.
- Installing an extension.

You can adjust these prompts in [Configuration](../reference/configuration.qmd).

::: {.callout-note}
Quarto Wizard can only display information provided by extension authors.
If an author has not provided a description, licence, or version tags, these fields will show "none".
